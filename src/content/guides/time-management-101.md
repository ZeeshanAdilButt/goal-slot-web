# Time Management 101

Welcome to Time Management 101. In this guide, we will cover the basics of managing your time effectively.

## Why Time Management Matters

Time is our most valuable resource. Once it's gone, we can't get it back. Effective time management allow you to:

- Accomplish more with less effort.
- Reduce stress.
- Improve work-life balance.

## The Eisenhower Matrix

One of the most popular methods for prioritization is the Eisenhower Matrix. It categorizes tasks into four quadrants:

1. **Urgent and Important**: Do these immediately.
2. **Important, but Not Urgent**: Schedule these.
3. **Urgent, but Not Important**: Delegate these.
4. **Neither Urgent nor Important**: Eliminate these.

## Time Blocking

Time blocking is a method where you divide your day into blocks of time. Each block is dedicated to accomplishing a specific task or group of tasks and only those specific tasks.

### Steps to Time Block

1. Identify your high-priority tasks.
2. Estimate how long each task will take.
3. Block out time on your calendar.
4. Includes breaks!
