# Goal Setting Framework

Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals

To make sure your goals are clear and reachable, each one should be:

- **S**pecific (Simple, sensible, significant).
- **M**easureable (meaningful, motivating).
- **A**chievable (agreed, attainable).
- **R**elevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).
- **T**ime bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).

## Long-term vs Short-term Goals

- **Long-term goals**: What do you want to achieve in 1, 5, or 10 years?
- **Short-term goals**: What can you do this week or this month to get closer to your long-term goals?

## Reviewing Your Goals

Set aside time each week to review your progress.

1. What did I achieve?
2. What challenges did I face?
3. What do I need to adjust?

## Conclusion

Clear goals give you direction and help you stay motivated on your journey.
