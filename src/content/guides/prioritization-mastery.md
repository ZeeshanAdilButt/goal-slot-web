# Prioritization Mastery

Prioritization is the key to productivity. It's not about doing more things; it's about doing the *right* things.

## The 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle)

The Pareto Principle states that 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts.

- Identify the 20% of tasks that yield 80% of the results.
- Focus your energy on those tasks.

## The ABCDE Method

This is a simple prioritization technique:

- **A**: Tasks you *must* do (serious consequences if not done).
- **B**: Tasks you *should* do (mild consequences).
- **C**: Tasks that are *nice* to do (no negative consequences).
- **D**: Tasks to *delegate*.
- **E**: Tasks to *eliminate*.

## Eat That Frog

"If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning." - Mark Twain

- Tackle your most difficult and important task first thing in the morning.
- Once that is done, the rest of the day will feel easier.

## Conclusion

By mastering prioritization, you ensure that you are always working on your most impactful goals.
